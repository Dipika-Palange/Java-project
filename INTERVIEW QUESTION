Q1 What is oops? and its principles?
oops:reusability,extensibility
principles:

1.Abstraction:showing only functionality and hiding internal details. EX:ATM machine,mobile phone

2.Encapuslation:wrapping up or binding of data into single unit. EX:school bag.folder ,presentation
    it is achieved by using private field and getter setter methods
    
 3.Inheritance: property of one class can access in another class EX:Parents and child
 
 4.Polymorphism: one task perform in different ways.
   	compile time polymorphism
   	run time polymorphism
   	
 Q2. WHY JAVA is platform independent?
  java ->compile->byte code
  case sensitive
 
  Data Types:
  primitive data type:
  				int=4 byte -> 8digit number only
  				short=2byte
  				long=8 byte
  				char=2byte
  				float=4byte ->used 6 precised number
  				double=8byte
  				boolean=1bit
  				byte=1byte
  	OPERATOR:
  	  1.Addition:+,-*,/
  	  2.Logical:&&,|,!
      3.Assignment:+=,-=.*=
      4.Relational:<, >,==
      5.increment/decrement: 
      
      VARIABLE:
         It is storage of data,used to allocate memory space
         RULES:
          1.variable name can start with letter,underscore(_),or doller sign(&)
          2.do not include space between variable name
          3.do not use any special character expect _  and &
          4.do not include any keyword in variable name
          
   Q3.why pointer is not included in java
   Q4.What are primitive data type
   Q5.what is variable
   Q6.what are types of variable
   Q7.why main method is static in java
   Q8.can we write static public void main instead of public static void main
           yes ,because public and static are modifier
   Q9.can we change return type of main?
      no it give run time error as main method not found
   Q10.Can we change variable of command line argument      
   Q11.what is system.out.println	
  			system is a class present in java.lang package.	
  			out is a static reference print stream  class which is present inside system class
  			println is method present in print stream class 
    Q12.can we  create class as private or protected?
    Q13.if we have multiple classes in single  how will decide file name?
    Q14. difference between scanner and bufferedreader classes?
    Q15 diff.for loop and while loop
    Q16.diff.between while and do while
    17.what is use of conditional switch statement
    q18.what is array and its type
    q19.can  we change array after initialization
